- info:

My aim is an interesting job with a lot of challenging tasks and the opportunity to constantly develop and learn new things. I want to work in a team with a friendly atmosphere.

I am a good and fast learner, I easily perceive a large amount of information. I am ready to work hard and very persistent in the face of difficulties.

The lack of working experience in my case can be an advantage: I already have a lot of knowledge (in some areas), but at the same time it is easy for me to be onboarded in any workflow in a new company.
